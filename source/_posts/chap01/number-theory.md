This section is a review of number theory. This section is quite important, it cares about the accurate definition of conceptions that you ignores, which will be generalized to algebraic structures.

# Nature Numbers

We starts from **natural number**. Natural numbers can be defined by [Peano Axioms]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms ). In our whole course, natural numbers starts from 0, that is
$$
\mathbb N=\{0,1,2,\cdots\}
$$


**Least Integer Axiom**: There is a smallest integer in every nonempty subset of $\mathbb N$.

This is the definition of prime number. But I think it's better to define them in another way.

> **Definition.** A number $p$ is ***prime*** if $p\geq 2$ and for any $a,b\in\mathbb N$ if $p\mid ab$ then $p\mid a$ or $p\mid b$.

One can prove that the above two definitons are equal, but we are going to use the 2nd one to define prime elements in rings. As for the first one, a similar definition in ring is for irreducible elements.

We have "irreducible numbers" $\iff$ prime numbers.

For us, it is better to remember the 2nd definition as the def of prime numbers and regard the 1st def as a property.

Proof Sketch: Use the least integer axiom to argue that the set $C$ containing all integers which the property is false should be $\emptyset$.



# Mathematical Induction

We list 2 mathematical induction here without proofs.

Both theorems can be proved by useing least integer axioms.



# Division and Properties of Prime Numbers

One should be very careful when reviewing this part, since it will be used frequently in rings.

> ![](1573111063264.png)

Proof Sketch: The theorem can be proved by contradiction.

> ![](1573111118736.png)

:warning: Warning! The division algorithm makes sense, in particular, when $b$ is negative. Divided by same $a$, $b$ and $-b$ usually leave different remaiders.

There are many proofs of this corollary, the most famous one is Euclid's. More proof's can be found in Hardy's impressive book.

> ![](1573111379887.png)

**Divisibility** cares about whether $b$ is a multiple of $b$, but cares nothing about which multiple $b$ is.

The next theorem is quite important. We write down the whole proof.

> ![](1573111808358.png)

Proof Sketch: The proof uses a basic idea in ring, the ideal. By find the smallest positive $d$ in $I=\{sa+tb|s,t\in\mathbb Z\}$, one can prove that $I=(d)$.

**Proof**: Let $I=\{sa+tb|s,t\in\mathbb Z\}$, then $I\neq \{0\}$. Since $a\in I\iff -a\in I$, $I$ must contain a least integer, we call it $d$. We now prove $I=(d)=\{kd|k\in\mathbb Z\}$.

- Clearly, $(d)\subseteq I$, since $d=sa+tb$ for some $s,t\in \mathbb Z$ then $kd=(ks)a+(kt)d$.
- $I\subseteq (d)$. For any $e\in I$, $e=dq+r$ where $0\leq r< d$  for some $d,r$. Since $e,dq\in I\Rightarrow r=e-dq\in I$, then $r=0$.

Then $d$ could devide $a$ and $b$. Can there be some $d'\geq d$ that $d'$ devides $a$ and $b$ lies in $I$? No, if positive $d'$ devides $a$ and $b$ and larger than $d$, then $d$ divides $d'$.

> ![](1573112839304.png)

> ![](1573113565337.png)

$I$ is the ideal of $\mathbb Z$ generated by $d$.



> ![](1573113672759.png)

This can be induced by our definition of prime numbers.

This proposition can be proved by [Binomial Theorem]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem ).

> ![](1573113936311.png)

This proposition can be proved by using **Theorem 1.7**.



The next proposition talks about base.

> ![](1573114008887.png)

The proposition can be proved by division algorithm and least integer axiom.





Fundamental theorem of arithmetic talks about the  unique fractorization of a integer $a\geq 2$.

> ![](1573114159930.png)

Proof Sketch: This theorem can be proved by induction and Euclid's Lemma.

> ![](1573114263039.png)

> ![](1573218044602.png)

Proof Sketch: I prefer proof by contradiction, since it's straightforward.



# Modulo Algorithm

> ![](1573218259126.png)

The modulo algorithm on integers is straightforward, we have to stress that it can be explain by the language of group or ring. And modulo algorithm can be generalized to groups and rings.

> ![](1573218455861.png)

These just say a modulo relationship is a congruence.

> ![](1573218650230.png) 

> ![](1573218785967.png)

We now introduce some very important inductions. They are quite powerful and frequently used in cryptography, thought easy to be proved.

> ![](1573219335276.png)

Proof Sketch: Again use the binomial theory.

> ![](1573219375780.png)

I prefer to use group theory to prove Fermat theory. It  can also be proved by mathematical induction.

> ![](1573219807052.png)

Proof Sketch: Use Fermat Theory (1.24).
