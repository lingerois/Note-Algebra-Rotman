Remember that a binary operation is just a function defines on two groups $A, B$, where $A$ is a cartesian products of two $B$'s. Note since $\ast$ is a function $G\times G\to G$,  $\ast(g_1,g_2)$ and $\ast(g_2,g_1)$ might be distinct.

We wright $a\ast b$ instead of $\ast(a,b)$ for simplicity.

We are study the structure of a group. And the structure is given by an binary operator, this is the group. We give some examples for non-groups, the reader can give some examples of groups by fix the non-group examples.

1. $\mathbb Z_8=\{0,1,2,\mod,7\}$ with the operation $\ast:(a,b)\to a\cdot b\mod 8$ is a non-group, because $4$ has no invert.
2. $\mathbb Z$ with operator minus is a non-group, because only element $e\in\mathbb Z$ that makes $x-e=x$ for all $x\in\mathbb Z$ is $0$. But for every $x\neq 0$, $0-x=-x$, so there's no identity in $\mathbb Z$.
3. $\mathbb Z$ with operator multiplication is a non-group, since no elements excepts $\pm 1$ has an inverse.
