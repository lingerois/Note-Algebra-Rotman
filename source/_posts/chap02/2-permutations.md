**Permutation** of a countable set means you change the order of the set. First you have to give the set an order, then you change the order of it. For $X=\{a,b,c\}$ one might define the order $1:a, 2:b,3:c$. And then, to permute it, say $1:b,2:c,3:a$. For a fixed original order, every permuted can be represent by an bijection $X\to X$. In our example, we have bijection $f:a\mapsto b,b\mapsto c,c\mapsto a$. For uncoutable sets, for example $Y$, there's no order, but we still say that a bijection $Y\to Y$ is a permutation.
