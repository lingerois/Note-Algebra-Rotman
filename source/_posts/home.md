# Introduction

This is a set of algebra notes follow Rotman's book *Advanced Modern Algebra, 1st Edition*. Hope you enjoy it.

# Why the 1st Edition

The newest version of this book is the 3rd Edition. I wrote the notes for the 1st Editition due to: (listed by most important ot least important)

1. There's only 1 copy of the 3rd Edition in my school's library, which is hard to borrow.
2. There's ebook of the 1st version on the Internet. Any one can download it easily.
3. It's more convenient to snap contents compared to type by myself. (But I'm still glad to type if there's a copy for me).
