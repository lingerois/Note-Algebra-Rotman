# Introduction

This is a set of algebra notes follow Rotman's book *Advanced Modern Algebra, 1st Edition*. Hope you enjoy it.

# Why the 1st Edition

The newest version of this book is the 3rd Edition. I wrote the notes for the 1st Editition due to: (listed by most important ot least important)

1. There's only 1 copy of the 3rd Edition in my school's library, which is hard to borrow.
2. There's ebook of the 1st version on the Internet. Any one can download it easily.
3. It's more convenient to snap contents compared to type by myself. (But I'm still glad to type if there's a copy for me).



# How to Use?

I have some individual advice for studying things like algebra.



*<u>**The idea of the proof is always more important by the proof itself.**</u>*

One might check it proof line by line to decide it. But that's not the right way to learn a proof. To check a proof line by line, you can only be convinced the proof is right. So why night do it by yourself? Why not use a proof checking software instead? And you can check all the proofs in one shot after some typing works!

All proofs are just rigorous descriptions of simple ideas. The primes can be defined as
$$
x\text{ is prime}\iff x\in\mathbb Z_+\wedge \text{card} (S=\{y\in\mathbb Z_+|\exists r\in \mathbb Z_+:y = x\cdot r\})=2
$$
If you can read this description quickly, its a good thing. But if you remember this as a definition for prime numbers without figure out the meaning behind it, it would be a terrible thing.



***<u>Start from easy ones.</u>***

For algorithms and new definitions, it's always good for one to give yourself an example to comprehend it. If the examples in the book is too difficult, you can always start with easy ones by yourself.



***<u>Try to reduce new ones to old ones.</u>***
